# napclock

iOS app that calculates amount of sleep someone should get based on REM cycles. Based on HackEDBeta Project, "sleepy-time" and made to try to learn swift things

TODOs:
- [ ] adding a nice gradient background
- [ ] have multiple view controllers so that the suggested times aren't just pop-ups
- [ ] fix iPad 57px icon (builder reads as ambiguous)
- [ ] add more suggestions i.e. not just the typical 6-hour sleep
      - could include various cycles (ranging from 1 through 6 cycles)
- [ ] add option of knowing when to sleep, then what time someone should wake up
- [ ] handle "null" input for time
